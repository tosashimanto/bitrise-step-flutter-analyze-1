title: Flutter Analyze
summary: This Step runs the `flutter analyze` command in a Flutter project.
description: |-

  The `flutter analyze` command is a wrapper around the [dartanalyzer](https://pub.dev/packages/analyzer) tool. It performs static analysis of your code. Check out the [available analysis options](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/blob/master/analysis_options.yaml) in the Flutter repository.

  ### Configuring the Step

  1. Set the **Project Location** input to the source directory of your app.

     By default, you do not have to change this.
  
  2. Set the **Fail Severity** input to the minimum level that should make the step fail.

     By default, the step fails on errors only. For example, you can set it to warning to make the step fail on both analyze errors and analyze warnings.

  3. Add any flags you want to the `flutter analyze` command in the **Additional Parameters** input.

     Run `flutter analyze --help` to check out the available flags. For example, you can set a flag so that the command only shows an output when there are some errors, warnings, hints or lints.
