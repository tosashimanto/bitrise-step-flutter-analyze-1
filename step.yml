title: Flutter Analyze
summary: This Step runs the `flutter analyze` command in a Flutter project.
description: |-

  The `flutter analyze` command is a wrapper around the [dartanalyzer](https://pub.dev/packages/analyzer) tool. It performs static analysis of your code. Check out the [available analysis options](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/blob/master/analysis_options.yaml) in the Flutter repository.

  ### Configuring the Step

  1. Set the **Project Location** input to the source directory of your app.

     By default, you do not have to change this.

  1. Add any flags you want to the `flutter analyze` command in the **Additional Parameters** input.

     Run `flutter analyze --help` to check out the available flags. For example, you can set a flag so that the command only shows an output when there are some errors, warnings, hints or lints.
